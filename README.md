# Search Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize popular search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and more. This interactive application helps users understand how these algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features

- Visualizes **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Interactive grid: set start and end points, and add walls
- Animated search path and final shortest path
- Clear and reset functionality

##  Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the current depth before going deeper.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
